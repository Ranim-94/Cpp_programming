## Repo Structure

- Each directory focuses on a specific idea or concept in C++.
- Examples include object-oriented programming, pointers, templates, inheritance, and more.

## Building

- Projects are currently built using Makefiles and the `g++` compiler.
- I plan to explore CMake for build automation in the future.
