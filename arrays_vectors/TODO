To organize after a revision about std::array



List of mistakes done (so I can learn from them always):


- always in some .cpp file, make sure that header file name in 
    the #include are spelled correctly
    - otherwise functions prototype will not be recognized

- don't forget the std for containers type, such  as
    std::vector<int>, ...
