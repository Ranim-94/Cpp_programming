In Cpp, we can have functions with same
name, but different list of arguments

Example:

void print_Val(std::string msg, bool new_line);

void print_Val(int nb, bool new_line);

In our program, we can use print_Val()

    1- as long as the list of arguments are diffenret

    2- and the return type is different
     in this case void <-> we can't have different return type,
     because otherwise the compiler couldn't differentiate between them
